# OmidNP

Here, I document my journey from foundational concepts to **structured, scalable solutions**.<br>
I am dedicated to writing clean, maintainable code and refining my understanding of software architecture with every project.
<br><br>
<i>I believe the best way to grow is through collaboration and feedback. If you see room for improvement or want to discuss an idea, I’d be happy to connect and hear your thoughts.</i>

## How I Build

- 🔍 **Analyze:** Breaking down requirements to handle edge cases and logical scenarios.
- 🗄️ **Design:** Structuring the database first to ensure data integrity and performance.
- 🛠️ **Develop:** Building clean services with **Laravel**, leveraging its core features properly.
- 🚀 **Deliver:** Ensuring the **entire project** (API, setup, and docs) is well-tested and reproducible.

## Computer Engineering Fundamentals

Before defining myself as a developer, I am a **Computer Engineering Student**.
<br>
My journey isn't just about building applications; it's about mastering the underlying logic that makes them possible.
<br>
I am deeply passionate about the **science of computation**—understanding memory, algorithmic efficiency, and the structural integrity of software.
<br>
This section is dedicated to my experiments in pure computer science and the foundational languages that power modern systems.

      <h3>📐 Algorithms & Logic</h3>
      <p>
        I don't just write code that works; I strive to write code that is optimal.
        <br>
        Here, I explore complex <b>Data Structures</b> and algorithmic patterns to solve problems with mathematical precision.

      <h3>⚡ C & Deep Execution</h3>
      <p>
        I use <b>C</b> to discipline my coding mindset.
        <br>
        Working with C forces me to understand manual <b>Memory Management</b> and pointers, making me a better engineer in high-level frameworks.

      <h3>⚙️ OS & Concurrency</h3>
      <p>
        Software doesn't run in a vacuum.
        <br>
        I study <b>Operating System</b> concepts to understand how processes, threads, and resources are managed to build scalable applications.
